                <p>Paper: 30cm unryu</p>
                <p>An hp version of the classic <a href="../portfolio/turtle.html">"plant's turtle"</a>. Just
                    as the original turtle had become a popular crease pattern as an intro 
                    to box pleating, my hope was that this turtle too would become an intro to hex 
                    pleating, and demonstrate some of hp's various abilities without having to 
                    sink time into a super complex cp.

                <p>This turtle features many improvements over the old one. Not only is the shell 
                    pattern made of actual hexagons (which of course, fits well with hex pleating), 
                    but now there are fin textures, a cleaner undershell, and a legit head with 
                    actual eyes. These other improvements are also results of the lesser-known 
                    advantages of hex pleating. The hp train is rolling, the future is now
