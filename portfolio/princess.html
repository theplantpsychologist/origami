                <p>Designed and folded July 2019</p>
                <p>Paper: 40cm tracing paper</p>
                <p>This was the first human figure that I would say I really got right. The shaping was just ok (partly
                    because this particular tracing paper was not great), but the proportions and the hair used in this 
                    design have worked pretty well since for other models since this one.
