                <p>(Re)designed and folded March 2021</p>
                <p>Paper: 70cm wenzhou</p>
                <p>This model has quite a story behind it. I was participating in a folding contest on Facebook, and 
                    the final round was to fold this Fallen Angel model originally designed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kennosaya/featured">Yoshimasa Tsuruta</a>.
                    They gave us the task on a Monday and we had to finish by Friday at midnight; at the same time that week, I was spending
                    6-8 hours a day finishing up the <a href="./grim reaper.html">grim reaper</a> for another origami contest,
                    on top of schoolwork, exams, and a part time job.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, I was left with under 48 hours to test fold the original model, redesign it entirely, and 
                    refold it--a process that can normally take weeks. I stayed up late and woke up early and folded during
                    online class. I would have liked to shape it a bit more, but I managed to turn it in on time and got
                    second place.
                    <br><br>
                    I did not win the grim reaper's contest either; as far as I know, none of the other artists were in both contests
                    at once. It's safe to say that at the end of the week (which was the end of both contests, which had been going on for 
                    over a month), I was burnt out and felt about as dead as the grim reaper 
                    I had made--all in exchange for just a bit of internet clout. Do not sign up for more than you can handle,
                    do not spread yourself thin, and do not burn yourself out in the meaningless pursuit of the praises of mankind.

                <p>I didn't draw a full cp for a number of reasons (mainly because it was a lot of work) but I 
                    did think it would be worth showing a comparison of the packings to show how much I ended up
                    modifying the model. I reduced the grid size by adding pythagorean stretches, changed the 
                    proportions of the arms, rearranged the head and body to add robe details, and added an entire 
                    shaped skull where the original model had just an empty hood.
