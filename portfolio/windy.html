                <p>Designed and folded May 2022</p>
                <p>Paper: 40cm double tissue</p>
                <p>The goal of this model (in addition to being another figure in the 
                    series of ordinary people designs) was to create a sense of motion 
                    in an unmoving paper figure. This first requires shaping each part 
                    (sleeves, dress, hair, scarf) in a way that appears like they're being 
                    blown around by the wind--then, posing the figure in a way that someone 
                    might look while walking upwind: leaning forward, shielding their face, 
                    squinting a bit, and so on. Overall I think the illusion worked.

                <p>Technically, the only remarkable aspect is that instead of having one arm on each 
                    side of the paper (like most human figures), both arms are arranged on the right side, 
                    and one is twisted over. Although this idea sounds weird at first, I believe this 
                    is a much more effective layout.
