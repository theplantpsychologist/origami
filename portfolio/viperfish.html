                <p>Designed and folded May 2020</p>
                <p>Paper: 60cm tracing paper</p>
                <p> This model was the first model I ever designed with scales. It also happened to 
                    be the first design that I used <a href="https://youtu.be/SFaa3Ko2L-4">orihime</a> 
                    to draw the crease pattern. Up to this point I had done my designing work with pencil and 
                    paper and used oripa to painfully slowly record the cp at the end, but with orihime 
                    I was able to efficiently and smoothly draw and rearrange the cp as I worked, and 
                    have a finished cp at the end when I was done.

                <p> Scales are strange things. What made this crease pattern especially hard to figure 
                    out was that there is a point halfway down the body where it transitions from 3 scales 
                    wide to just 2. This is necessary to maximize the length of the body, but was pretty 
                    annoying to come up with and pretty annoying to fold.
