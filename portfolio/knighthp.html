                <p>Designed and folded August 2023</p>
                <p>Paper: 50cm foil</p>
                <p>This was a further exploration into what hex pleating could do for human figures. In this case, hex pleating allows for more efficient level shifters to create all the different armor pieces--as a result, the height of folded model is around a third of the height of the paper.

                    This design was my submission for the 2023 Tanteidan convention's design contest, whose theme was simply "human figures." I spent most of the summer designing a v1 that ultimately was unsatisfactory (you can find it on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwK0qibpn7e/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">instagram</a>), and in the last 5 days leading up to the convention, completely redesigned and refolded the model that you see here. I ultimately didn't win but I'm glad to have been able to show something interesting with hex pleating.

                <p>I ended up slightly tweaking the crease pattern in a few spots when I actually folded it (I had to print out and finalize the cp before the model was done and haven't bothered to update it) so please contact me if you for some reason decide to fold this, and have questions.
