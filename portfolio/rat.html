                <p>Designed in 2013 (bottom), redesigned August 2017 (top)</p>
                <p>Paper: 25cm square of printer paper</p>
                <p>This is perhaps my oldest design that I still have; I still vaguely remember showing it to my friend after school 
                    in 5th grade. I started by 
                    making horizontal pleats across the back and curving it into a sorta spike ball, then freefolded the bp to make the 
                    rest of the body.
                    <br><br>Eventually, I came back and lowered the grid size (from 32 to 12) to make it less skinny and easier to fold, but I 
                    still didn't really know what exactly it most looked like so for a while I just called it "rodent" or something.
                    I now think a rat is the closest, but it can definitely be shaped into other things.
                    <br><br>At any rate, here's the bottom line: understanding design theory and advanced techniques is great, but 
                    you don't <i>need</i> them to start designing. All you need is the imagination of a child.
