                <p>Designed and folded November 2020</p>
                <p>Paper: 60cm single tissue</p>
                <p>I don't remember why I decided I wanted to make a shark skeleton out of all things, but regardless, I learned 
                    a lot of new techniques through the design process of this model: namely, diagonal symmetry for a box pleated model,
                    two different ways to make spikes/teeth (upper and lower jaw are different), and most of all, pythagorean stretches.

                <p> This was the model for which while I was designing it, all of a sudden <a href="https://youtu.be/BDiDOsAM44c">pythagorean stretches</a>
                    made perfect sense; and as such, the model has a bunch of them (the blue parallelogram things). Tl;dr for pythagorean stretches 
                    (pythas): they aren't noticeable from the outside, but they allow for much more efficient layouts, resulting
                    in less thickness and smaller necessary paper size, which results in making things easier to shape.
                    <br><br>Since the model is diagonally symmetrical, I have only drawn the full crease pattern for the bottom half. 
                    On the other side is the packing so that it's easier to see the layout of the flaps and rivers.
