                    getting the head to look right was as hard as always.

                <p>I believe this model has one of the most interesting crease patterns I have ever designed.
                    It is a strange mashup of hex pleating, tilted grid, and unaxial box pleating. It's hex pleating
                    because the creases all lie at angles of multiples of 30 with each other, it feels like tilted
                    grid because it's diagonally symmetric and none of the creases line up with the edge of the square,
                    and it's unaxial because there are no flaps or hinges and the model is essentially an extreme
                    case of level shifters. I suppose this could be referred to as "unaxial hex pleating," a 
                    style that I have only seen in one or two other models out there.
                      <br><br>Grid: ???? The diagonal is divided into 18ths, otherwise not sure how to 
                      call this grid
