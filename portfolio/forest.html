                <p>Designed and folded August 2020</p>
                <p>Paper: 60cm double tissue</p>
                <p>This was another one of those things that I designed just to see how complex I could go. This 
                    was also right after folding the ryujin 3.5, and scales were still fresh in my head--so naturally,
                    when I returned to the problem of creating multiple trees from the same sheet, the solution that 
                    I thought of for creating leafy textures was something similar to the scales used in models like 
                    ryujin.

                <p>Each corner of the cp is one of the 4 trees, with two small trees on top and two big trees at the 
                    bottom. There's quite a lot of wasted space, but it gets the job done and creates indeed a forest 
                    from a single sheet of paper.
                    <br><br>Grid: 56x56, with partial 112ths for the leaf pleats.
