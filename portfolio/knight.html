                <p>Designed and folded October 2020</p>
                <p>Paper: 55cm double tissue</p>
                <p>I remember as a kid dreaming of even folding a model like this, a powerful warrior with a sword and shield and slick armor.  
                    After many failed attempts over the years, I am proud to say that I have fulfilled the dream and not only folded such a figure, but designed my own.
                    <br><br>It was a pain to fold though. I think part of it was because of the paper; it requires a very large paper 
                    to be able to do the tiny details in the helmet and to not have to wrestle with thick layers in the limbs,
                    but in order to get a clean color change I was limited to double tissue, of which 55-60cm was about as big as I could get.

                    The most interesting aspect of this model is the abundance of color change. Much like the <a href="./grim reaper.html">grim reaper</a>,
                    the trick is to place all the color changed (blue) parts around the edge of the square: the shield in the top right, sword
                    in the top left, cape on the right edge and plume on the top edge, and so on.

                    <br><br>Grid: 64x64
                    <br><br>Here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15KmlFGRwykBLCD_wlhgzg0s7UwgjXsvB/view">photodiagram guide</a>
                    for collapsing the helmet, by far the hardest part of this model.
