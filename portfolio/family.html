                <p>Designed and folded June 2021</p>
                <p>Paper: 70cm wenzhou</p>
                <p>Yes, three people folded from the same uncut square. A personal record I suppose. <br><br>
                    This design took over a month from start to finish, from the initial sketch/inspiration, 
                    to the packing/structure, and then an in depth study into face shaping (ie, a grind of 
                    trying and failing again and again on scrap papers). <br><br>
                    The three faces in this model display variation in age, gender, and most of all: emotion. 
                    The method i used to use often yielded very angry expressions simply due to the layout of flaps, 
                    which was the opposite of what I needed, so I had to figure out how to work around that. 
                    It's also difficult when the kid's face is smaller than my fingernail. <br><br>
                    In the end, this model is really just a sheet of paper, yet through just the process of 
                    folding it's now distinctly able to radiate a sense of affection and contentment. 
                    I'm very happy with it, and I hope it makes you happy as well!

                <p>The unique technical aspect of this model is that it is polyaxial: one axis for the dad/kid, 
                    and one axis for the mom. This allows the mom and dad to be neatly spaced together and 
                    connected from shoulder to ankle. Additionally, the dad's legs are not separate flaps,
                    since I knew the pose would not require such. Overall, this model is pretty efficient,
                     considering many single figure models also use a 48 grid.
