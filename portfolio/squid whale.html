                <p>Paper: 40cm tissue foil</p>
                <p>I came up with this design when I was 12, and so for quite some time this was by far my best design.
                    Back in middle school we did a squid dissection in class one time, and so for a few months after that 
                    I had an odd fascination for squids, and designed a few other "Squid eating ____" models... most of 
                    which did not turn out very well in retrospect.

                    <br><br>
                    I believe the other reason why I was making so many squids was because they're relatively simple. From 
                    a bp point of view, a squid is just a center flap for the body with 8 small flaps (arms) and 2 long
                    flaps (tentacles), perhaps with eyes too but that's about it. You don't have to worry about level 
                    shifters either. Thus, all I had to do was pack all the flaps, and the design was basically done.
                    <br><br>
                    The weird bird base in the bottom right was to squeeze in the squid's second eye. At the time I didn't 
                    understand how pythagorean stretches work, but I knew enough to know that it was indeed possible 
                    to squeeze in a small flap in the gap, so I just fudged something up, mushed it up and hid it in the layers,
                    and made it work somehow. 
                    <br><br>I did know how to do a natural color change for the whale, though. That was cool.
