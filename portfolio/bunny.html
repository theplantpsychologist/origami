                <p>Designed and folded January 2023</p>
                <p>Paper: 25cm cardstock</p>
                <p>One challenge I've had for a while was to make an animal structure that 1) looks good from both the side and front, 2) looks soft and round like a stuffed animal, and 3) can be easily adapted to make other animals. A while back i found a bp structure that worked somewhat, but now coming back with hp it all seems to click perfectly. (Think about how an icosahedron with equilateral triangles seems much more round than a cube--in the same way, 3d models made with hex pleating can appear much more organic than those made with box pleating.)
                <br><br>
                So here's a chubby stuffed animal-like model who has achieved what I was seeking: it looks ok from both the front and side, it looks soft and round, and it can be easily adapted into other animals. I hope to make more variations of these in the future.

                <img src="./cps/bunnyhp cp.jpg">
                <p>The cp is a bit tricky and very 3d. The head and body are inside out relative to one another (which is the key to looking good from both the front and side as mentioned before), so having the mv reversed version of the cp on hand becomes helpful while folding. Also watch out that the head and body will be different colors on duo paper.
