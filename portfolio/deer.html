                <p>Designed and folded January 2022</p>
                <p>Paper: 22cm and 20cm kraft</p>
                <p>It turns out that the shaping techniques you can use to created gendered human figures can also 
                    be used to create gendered animals--similar to what animation studios do every single time.
                    Even if the proportions aren't completely realistic (real adult deer are skinnier and have 
                    smaller heads than these anyways), it will be clear to human viewers.
                    <br><br>For example, in adult humans, women usually have thinner necks, and men usually have 
                    wider shoulders. I don't know if this is true in deer as well, but regardless, I shaped the 
                    female deer to have a thinner neck and the male to have a wider/puffier chest area. The result 
                    is that it's quite obvious which deer is male and which is the female, even without the antlers.

                <img src="./cps/deer cp.svg">
                <p>The cp on the left is the male; the reference (green lines) is the intersection of a 22.5 crease 
                    and a crease with slope of 3. The cp on the right is the female; the reference is the classic 
                    "Kamiya reference."
                    <br><br>The structures between the two are pretty similar, the only difference is the male is 
                    wider down the middle, which allows for more detail in the head for the antlers. Because of this, the female is 
                    a bit more efficient, and if you want the female to be the same size (or smaller) than the male,
                    you will want to fold the female with a smaller square than the male.
