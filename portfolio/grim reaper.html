                <p>Designed and folded March 2021</p>
                <p>Paper: 60cm black single tissue, with white acrylic on one side</p>
                <p>This model was created for an origami design contest with other highly talented designers, so I 
                    needed this one to be as impressive as possible by flexing the most details, color changes, and 
                    shaping that I could. 
                    <br><br>
                    Using painted single tissue was an actual lifesaver, in fact I had originally folded it from 
                    wenzhou before realizing it wouldn't work and starting over completely. 
                    Painted single tissue was the only thing that could hold the strong black-white contrast I needed, 
                    while still being thin enough to shape tiny skull details and create a thin ragged look on the robe.

                <p>This model has a lot of details. Essentially the way it's done is that 
                    the body is just a huge center flap, and everything else (skull/hood, bird, arms, knife/belt)
                    are placed around the edge, which also allow them to be easily color changed.
