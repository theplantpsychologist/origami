                <p>Designed and folded January 2021</p>
                <p>Paper: 70cm wenzhou</p>
                <p>This was the first real human figure design I did with a face, and although I was super happy with
                    the result when I first folded this design, I now see the way I did it here was not the greatest.
                    I also slightly messed up the proportions. However, I am proud of the unique arrangement of of the flaps,
                    the extent you can really only see in the crease pattern, and also the pose turned out ok.

                <p> This crease pattern has a super unusual arrangement for a human figure. The normal arrangement can be roughly
                    seen in <a href="./journey.html">this design,</a> where the left arm is in the top left corner, the right arm 
                    is in the top right corner, and the head is in between. But for this model, you have the head and the body off
                    on the right side, the left arm is right in the center, and the right arm + the stick are arranged around 
                    the top left corner. As strange as this sounds, I am convinced that this odd arrangement is the most efficient 
                    for this particular figure.
                    <br><br>Grid: 40x40. This was the first time I used such a large paper size to grid size ratio,
                    and it really paid off for shaping the small hand and face details.
