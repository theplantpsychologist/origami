                <p>My first time using hex pleating for a human figure. However, the significance 
                    in this model is not in the technical side, but in the biblical symbolism behind
                    the relationship between a shepherd and a sheep.
                    <br><br>
                    Who is God, and what is He like? The Bible gives us many metaphors to help 
                    us understand God and how He relates to us--in this case, the relationship 
                    between a shepherd and a sheep. The photo journey below quotes from Psalm 23,
                     a poem written by King David who was a shepherd himself. He describes God 
                     as his own shepherd: someone who provides everything he needs, brings him peace, 
                     walks with him and guides him, and protects him from danger. God is not just 
                     some distant ruler, but is personal, gentle, and loves us as His sheep.
                    <br><br>
                     But there's more to the story. Centuries later, the prophet Isaiah writes that 
                     "All we like sheep have gone astray" (Isaiah 53:6) and prophesies that someone 
                     will have to come to bear our sins. After that, the prophet Ezekiel writes, 
                     "For thus says the Lord God: 'Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep 
                     and will seek them out'" (Ezekiel 34:11).
                     <br><br>
                     And finally, over 400 years later, Jesus comes in and declares, "'I am the 
                     good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep" (John 10:11).
                      Jesus fulfilled both prophesies: he was the one who brought us back by bearing
                       the sins of us sheep who wandered away, and he was the prophesied "good 
                       shepherd"--God Himself personally seeking us.
                    <br><br>
                    Even though for now Jesus is no longer here physically, God does not change, 
                    and the reality of the Lord being our shepherd is just as real now as it was 
                    for David. There are times in this life when we feel like lost sheep, wandering 
                    around in the darkness, longing for still waters and green pastures. But the 
                    good news is that we have a good shepherd in Jesus. All we have to do is turn 
                    back to Him in faith, and He will shepherd us forever.
