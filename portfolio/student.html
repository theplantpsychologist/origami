                <p>The origami world has many designs for knights and wizards and anime characters, 
                    but not many for ordinary 21st century people. I believe figures of this type
                     have a bit of an extra challenge because if proportions or details are off,
                      people will easily notice, whereas fictional characters are entirely up to the 
                      artist's imagination. I hope to make more figures of this type, but for now I've 
                      started with the most obvious place for me to start: a gen z male college student. 
                      (I happen to fit this category, but this was not intended to be a self portrait)

                <p>There are a couple interesting things about the structure of this design. The first 
                    is that he is closed back instead of closed belly--that is, his structure is 
                    backwards of what the vast majority of every other human figure design is made from. 
                    The second thing, related to the first, is that the model looks complete from pretty 
                    much any angle. Many human figure designs look good from the front but are messy from
                     the back because they aren't made to be seen from those angles, but because this guy
                      has a closed back, he still looks like a solid figure from front, back, or sides.
