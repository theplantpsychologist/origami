                <p>Skeletons are not actually as hard as they look. Because you don't really have to deal with 
                    flap widhts (all the bones are just skinny flaps, right?), it's really just a matter of coming
                    up with an efficient <a href="https://youtu.be/PzkAL2Dng20">packing</a>.

                <p>This cp is pretty straightforward, except for the ribs. Although the ribs look like center flaps,
                    I find them easier to fold if you think of them as level shifters, and the rivers between the ribs
                    are just a result of moving the pleats forward.
