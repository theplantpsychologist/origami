                <p>Paper: 60cm double tissue</p>
                <p>A lot of the shaping for this model i just improvised without planning everything beforehand. 
                    As a result, a few problems arose, such as that the right arm was too short and looked weird 
                    at the shoulder, or that the bra flap (which wraps around the back) was too thick and the 
                    transition was messy. The solution was to cover it up with other parts of the model; ie, the 
                    pose was chosen specifically so that the hair could cover the weird shoulder, and the left 
                    arm could cover the bra part.

                <p> This model uses the same hexagonal scale trick as the <a href="./rattlesnake.html">rattlesnake.</a>

                    Also, the face for this model turned out a lot better than previous human figure designs, 
                    after even more trial and error. The key for making a smile is not actually in the mouth,
                     nor the eyebrows, but in the illusion of raised cheeks under the eyes.
