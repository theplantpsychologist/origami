            <h1>Stone Golem</h1>
            <div class="model-photo">
                <img src="./photos/stone golems-5.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Refolded July 2020, but originally designed January 2018</p>
                <p>Paper: 40cm tissue foil</p>
                <p>A lot of the charm in origami are the illusions that can be used to make a single uncut square look 
                    like it's made of multiple sheets. Usually this means having <a href="./family.html">multiple figures</a> 
                    or having the figures <a href="./journey.html">holding things</a>, but in this case there is an illusion 
                    that the rocks are kinda just stacked on top of each other to make the golem.

                <p> This crease pattern is composed almost entirely of long center flaps and <a href="https://youtu.be/v4ZJzLWAK10">level shifters</a> 
                    that allow the model to look like it's made of wide rocks rather than a stick figure. However, there is 
                    a lot of wasted space (namely, above the head and to the sides of the body), so I would like to revisit 
                    and improve this model eventually one day.

                <p>The original fold, designed and folded January 2018</p>
                <p>Paper: 40cm tracing paper</p>
                <p>I think few designs have demonstrated growth and improvement over time as this one has. Surprisingly,
                    the structure of the crease pattern changed very little during the two and a half years between the two 
                    folds, yet they look dramatically different. The main difference is that the quality of my folded 
                    models jumped dramatically once I learned how to make <a href="https://youtu.be/TQlQxosxmZM">double tissue</a>,
                    or in this case, tissue foil. I had also improved a lot in my shaping abilities and was able to give
                    the model a bit of life and character.
                    <br><br>So, tl;dr: Refold your old designs, you might be surprised how much you improve over time. And 
                    getting good paper makes a pretty big difference, your paper could be limiting you right now.
