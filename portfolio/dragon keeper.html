                <p>Designed and folded February 2021</p>
                <p>Paper: 70cm wenzhou</p>
                <p>This model was one of the first real limit test of how complex of a model I could get from a 70cm
                    square. I would like to revisit this one day though, I feel like I did not do the hair and face 
                    (usually the biggest challenges) as well as I could have.

                <p>Each part of the model (the dragon, torch, hood, tunic, etc) was carefully test folded on its own
                    and then packed into the square for the final fold. This is usually the way things go for complex
                    designs like this.
