                <p>Designed and folded October 2020</p>
                <p>Paper: 25cm wenzhou tissue</p>
                <p>Probably the best thing about this model is how convenient it is; you can easily fold it from a normal 15cm square 
                    of kami, and it has a very high impressiveness to effort ratio.
                    <br><br>I ended up teaching this model at a Bolivian online convention, in Spanish. To practice for that, I 
                    recorded <a href="https://youtu.be/uxq-8PMj3u4">this tutorial</a> and sent it to the organizers to 
                    make sure I was using the right words and stuff.

                <p> Make sure to avoid unecessary creases, especially for a model like this with big wide surfaces (face and belly) where 
                    extra creases are very obvious and unpleasant.

                    <s>hint hint: are you looking to impress a certain someone with something round and cute but all you have 
                        is a 15cm square of duo kami? this is a good option, just sayin
