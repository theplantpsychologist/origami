                <p>My first time coming back to hex pleating since the <a href="../portfolio/rattlesnake.html">rattlesnake</a>
                    from over a year before. Dragons are quite a classic subject for origami designs, but up until now for 
                    some reason I never got around to it--so of course I had to go all in. 
                    For those of you who don't know, hex pleating means that the structures are all 
                    based on an isometric (equilateral triangles) grid rather than on a normal square 
                    grid (bp).

                <p>From a technical standpoint, this design utilizes 3 techniques beyond basic hp 
                    (which is by no means "basic") that makes it stand out. First, it uses hp ridge 
                    squashes to create the horizontal scale pleats; then it uses complex level shifters
                     to create the vertical scale pleats, that together form the grid of scales. Both
                     of these techniques are much more efficient than what bp designs usually use to 
                     create scales--they are also arguably easier to fold, as you can collapse the 
                     base first and then construct the scales. And third, this design does not shape 
                     the scales but rather leaves them as intersecting pleats, which if you carefully 
                     distort, you can use to control the 3d curvature of the body (ie, bulges and saddle points).

                    This was my first real foray into axial hex pleating (the rattlesnake, 
                    mermaid, and baby elephant were all a bit different) and therefore was quite a roller 
                    coaster in a way that I had never experienced with any previous design. As I told/vented
                     to my friends throughout these two weeks of design/folding grind, I had never felt 
                     as frustrated by origami as I felt some days trying to wrestle with these 60 degree 
                     structures--on other days, I had never felt so excited when things clicked, nor as
                      hopeful for the future of what hex pleating has in store for the origami world.
