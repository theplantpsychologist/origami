                <p>Collaboratively designed and folded with Boice Wong and Chris Conrad, 
                    during the OUSA convention, June 2022.</p>
                <p>Paper: 135cm Wenzhou</p>
                <p>Perhaps one of the biggest collaborations in origami history: three figures, 
                    designed in three different styles, folded by three people at the same time, 
                    all from a single uncut square. We designed this model over discord a few 
                    days before arriving at the convention, and then we folded the whole model 
                    together with all six hands on the paper at a time.

                <p>We decided to title this design "The Power of Friendship," loosely based on 
                    the lord of the rings (we have a hobbit, human, and elf) because the three 
                    figures are adventuring together with the power of friendship on their side. 
                    But more importantly, the design itself is a testament to the power of 
                    friendship--that is, friendships within the origami community. It's only when
                     people are able to form friendships and work together, like at a convention, 
                     that works like this can be created--and that's the power of friendship.

                <p>My hobbit is in the top left, Chris' elf archer is in the top right, and Boice's swordsman
                    is along the bottom edge. The green lines outline the rivers that separate the 3 figures.
                    Not only is the shaping style of each figure distinct by the artist, but even the crease 
                    patterns are recognizable as who drew what--my style is to use the usual large and cartoony
                    face structure, with many level shifters to create normal-person clothes.
