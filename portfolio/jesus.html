                <p>Paper: 40cm double tissue</p>
                <p>Origami is pretty good as a representative and expressive
                    art form, but I don't think any origami model could really do justice to depict the Son of God.
                    However, I think it is always good to remember that, as <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JAS.1.ESV">James 1:17</a>,
                     says, <i>"Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights."</i> These "good
                     and perfect gifts" certainly include big things like the gift of faith and salvation, or the blessings of 
                     having the people in our lives that we have, but I believe it would be a fair interpretation to say that 
                     our abilities, including artistic ones, are also gifts from God. There is no reason that I can 
                     fold things that a lot of people can't, other than that God has allowed me to. 

                    <br><br>With this in mind, how should we go about using the talents and abilities that God has placed in us?
                    <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/COL.3.ESV">Colossians 3:17</a> tells us, <i>"Whatever you do, in word
                    or deed, do everything in the name of Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him."</i> 
                    <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.12.ESV">Romans 12:6</a>, when discussing spiritual gifts 
                    (which are a bit different, but similar idea) tells us, <i>"Having gifts that differ
                    according to the grace given to us, let us use them."</i> We could also look at <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EXO.35.ESV">Exodus 35</a>
                    about the "skilled craftsmen" who helped make things for God's tabernacle.

                    <br><br>From my understanding of all the aforementioned passages, the point is this: our abilities are given 
                    to us from God, and as such we ought to use them for His purposes. For the skilled craftsmen, this would be 
                    quite obvious: God's tabernacle needed lamps and tables and stuff, so if you were someone who could work with 
                    metal or wood, you would make it for the Lord. With the spiritual gifts discussed in Romans 12, it's also pretty clear:
                    people gifted in preaching ought to go preach about the Lord, and so on.

                    <br><br>So how does origami fit into this? Obviously the creator of the universe does not <i>need</i> your folded piece 
                    of paper. But whenever we do something good for someone else, Jesus will count it as done for himself, as he says
                    in <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.25.ESV">Matthew 25:40</a>, <i>"'as you did it to one of the 
                    least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'"</i> 

                    <br><br>Being constantly surrounded by origami, I think I sometimes forget the value it can have for other people.
                    For example, once in high school I folded a small something during class and gave it to a friend; years later, I saw 
                    him again and he mentioned he still had it. Now if a 10 minute post-it fold could be valued that much, imagine 
                    the impact a carefully designed, quality paper, well shaped model might have on the recipient. How much would they appreciate the fact that 
                    you remembered their favorite thing or animal and cared enough to put in the effort to make it? How much comfort or happiness could this little piece of transformed paper 
                    bring them? What might God be able to do, without you knowing, in the life of the other person as a result of the little 
                    gift you gave them? Perhaps it will get unfolded or lost or forgotten, and that's ok. But perhaps God might do something cool.
                    
                    <br><br><b>Tl;dr</b>: origami and similar abilities are gifts from God, and as such we have a responsibility to use it 
                    for His purposes in return. We can serve Jesus when we serve others and use origami as a means of giving gifts from the heart,
                    and let God do the rest of the work.
