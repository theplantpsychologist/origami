                <p>Designed and folded January 2022</p>
                <p>Paper: 40cm double tissue</p>
                <p>The trickiest and most crucial part of this design is, as always, the faces. Creating smiling faces is an endeavor I have been experimenting with for quite a while now. 
                    There is still a lot more to learn, but I believe the trick is this: the mouth can vary from person to 
                    person, but the crucial feature is the raised cheeks under the eyes. This is what differentiates an evil 
                    smile from a genuinely happy one, or a forced smile from a calm but content expression.
                    <br><br>So with these three friends, you will see that they all have slightly different mouths, but they 
                    all have the same curved eyes and raised cheeks. And indeed they look pretty happy, as one should be 
                    with one's buddies.
                    <br><br>Random observation: when people get their photos taken individually, the smile is almost always 
                    visibly forced. But when they take the photo as a group and their arms are over each others shoulders 
                    and they have all the time in the world, these are pure and genuine grins, and it shows. So perhaps when 
                    taking yearbook photos or profile pics or whatnot we should just take them as groups and then 
                    crop out each face...

                <p>This design was another exploration of the technique used in the <a href="./family.html">family</a>
                    design--namely, multiaxial box pleating. In the family model, there are two axes, one for the 
                    dad and one for the mom. This time, there are three axes, one for each friend.
                    <br><br>Grid: 40x40
                    <br><br>It may be surprising to have such a low grid size for a design consisting of three 
                    figures; after all, it's not uncommon to have <a href="./dragon keeper.html">designs</a> with a single figure using grid sizes 
                    at 60 or higher. How do the friends accomplish this?
                    <br><br>First of all, their proportions are those of children, so all their flaps and rivers can 
                    be shorter and take up less space than an adult figure would need. (This was also done so that 
                    the faces would be more focused than if half of the paper went to their pants). Second, their bodies 
                    aren't really flaps (and that's where the multiaxial/non-uniaxial/unaxial stuff comes in); they are connected 
                    from shoulders to heels, and their legs aren't separable because the pose doesn't require so. Finally, 
                    the arms that wouldn't be visible in this pose were simply not included, which saves a lot of space. 
                    <br><br>Overall, this design is a nice example of reducing the structure to the bare minimum, and
                    it pays off.
