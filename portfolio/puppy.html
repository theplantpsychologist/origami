                <p>Designed and folded November 2020</p>
                <p>Paper: 30cm double calligraphy paper</p>
                <p>This design is perhaps one of my favorite examples of how origami is a blend of both art and engineering. On 
                    the art side: when you think about it, this puppy is basically the same paper material as <a href="./fallen angel.html">a model like this</a>,
                    yet through folding the puppy can create a very different soft, fluffy, and peaceful vibe. Yet underneath all 
                    the layers, the structure uses a very efficient and clever crease pattern, as explained below.
                    <br><br>I ended up teaching this model at the 2021 Origami USA online convention, and also sent the diagrams 
                    for that year's convention book.

                <p>This model was my first exploration into the <a href="https://youtu.be/rnsL1Vz7y20">tilted grid</a> design method,
                    a not-well-documented design method which at the time that I came up with the puppy, only one other artist 
                    (Shuki Kato) had understood. (tl;dr about tilted grid: it's one of the best ways to make very 3d animals, 
                    it's very space efficient, but it's hard to design and fold.) It took me many more months to figure it out well enough to make that video;
                    the puppy was mostly freehanded, rather than systematically designed. However, this does mean the puppy has 
                    a very smooth folding sequence <s>unlike a lot of other tilted grid models</s>
