            <h1>Japanese Spiny Lobster HP</h1>

                <p>A few years ago, Kota Imai's box pleated design of a japanese spiny lobster gained a lot of attention for the sheer complexity that went into making all the spines and textures of a lobster. It has since become among the ranks of the ryujin 3.5 as one of the top landmarks of complex origami, specifically for what box pleating could do.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, since the beginning of my hp journey it has been a goal of mine to recreate the jsl in hex pleating. As it turns out, it's arguably easier to make such textures through hex pleating than box pleating due to a few quirks of hp that allow you to squeeze out more pleats for less effort and less space.

                <p>This could be described as "multiaxial" hex pleating, or you could call it normal hp with some really complicated level shifters. In any case, it uses a weird layout to create the solid width of the body.
