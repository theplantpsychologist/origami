                <p>Designed and folded October 2019</p>
                <p>Paper: 40cm tissue foil (sandwich paper)</p>
                <p>There was supposed to be a deep message behind this design. The idea was that the guy is 
                    a busy 9 to 5 salaryman type guy with the suit and the hat, and when he sees the flower, he 
                    stops to take a picture of it rather than actually smelling it. Thus this is a representation 
                    of how in our current digital age we are slipping into a tendency to enjoy our lives through technology  
                    (by taking a picture) rather than in real life (actually smelling the rose).
                    <br><br><br>Was this an "I'm 14 and this is deep" moment? I was 16 at the time, but yeah
                    probably.

            <div class="model-cp">
                <p>For some reason I never drew the cp. The guy, the flower, and the ground are all from the same sheet, which I guess 
                    was pretty clever but also horribly inefficient and freehanded.
