                <p>Designed somewhere in 2014 or 2015, refolded many times</p>
                <p>Paper in the model shown: 20cm double tissue </p>
                <p>Sometime around 2019, this model became pretty popular as a beginner crease pattern, and as more people folded 
                    it as their first cp, more people started recommending it to others, and eventually started to 
                    be referred to as "Plant's turtle." I've seen probably over 60ish people having folded it, including people like
                    my high school English teacher who don't normally do origami, so this model has a pretty special place for me.
                    <br><br>Because of its simplicity, it's also been a pretty good go-to model for folding from scrap 
                    paper at school or other places.

                <p>If you get stuck folding the cp, you can find a tutorial <a href="https://youtu.be/LL2d1WjBTR4">here</a>. 
                    <br><br>The main technical features of this design are level shifters. There are 4 <a href="https://youtu.be/PPyQmFRZKjw">ridge level shifters</a>, 
                    one in each corner, and the shell pattern is also basically just level shifters.
