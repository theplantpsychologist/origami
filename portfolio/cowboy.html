                <p>Designed and folded July 2022</p>
              
                <p>A tricky multi-subject model, and the first real model I designed
                    and folded while at MIT.
                    <br><br>
                    One challenge presented by this model is that 
                    there is quite a large difference in the proportions of the horse 
                    and the rider. This meant that I had to not only figure out the correct 
                    proportions of a horse, but also make it fit the proportions of the rider. 
                    I also had to figure out how to change the grid size of a very large 
                    section of the paper for the rider.
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="model-cp">
                <img src="./cps/cowboy cp.svg">
                <p> Grid size: 32 with partial 64ths
                    <br><br>

                    The other main challenge was figuring out the connection between the horse's
                     back and the guy's legs--having a river protrude from the middle of a closed 
                     back is quite difficult. It's a bit hard to describe what I did but if you 
                     look closely at the cp you might see what my jank solution was. After all, 
                     efficient designing is all about pulling off illusions, isn't it.
