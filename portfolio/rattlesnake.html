                <p>This has been perhaps my most prided design for quite a while. It uses a very unique
                    technical structure that I am proud to have figured out, and also uses a wire and stuffing
                    and other shaping techniques to make it as realistic as possible.

                <p>The most notable technical aspect of this design is that this model is primarily based on a normal, 
                    rational, square grid, but transitions into an isometric grid (based on the square root of 3) 
                    to create scales that are perfect hexagons. It turns out these scales are about 50% more efficient 
                    than the normal square scales. This means that if you can deal with the square root of 3 
                    stuff that will never line up with the grid (which is quite a big if, unfortunately), this
                    technique could be used to bring about a new generation of scaled models. 
                    Including, possibly, a ryujin 4.0
