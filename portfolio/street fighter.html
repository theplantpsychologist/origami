                <p>Designed and folded July 2020</p>
                <p>Paper: 40cm double tissue</p>
                <p>The main thing that makes this design cool are the color changes. It really looks like he's wearing
                    clothes, even though they're just flaps protruding from his legs and shoulders.

                <p> Two hints if you plan to fold this model. First, he does not have four arms, the flaps in the 
                    top corner get color changed and go over his shoulders to form the vest. Second, don't worry or 
                    precrease too much in the headband.
