                <p>Personal project</p>
                <p> Unlike a lot of other Asian American kids, I never had to learn piano as a kid, and in fact basically never touched a piano my whole life until college--so when I arrived to campus as a freshman, I decided to start dabbling around on the pianos in my dorm or other communal areas on campus. But in order to practice without everyone hearing me mess up, I thought it would be nice to have a small piano (at least two octaves) to practice on my own in my room. Thus, this project to 3d print a piano.

                <p> The piano uses thin PLA pieces as keys that can bend elastically when pressed. Underneath are copper tapes that can detect when a key is pressed, and then sends the signal to an arduino input. 
                    <br><br>
                After that, the signal is sent from the arduino to a python program, which plays the appropriate sound files. The two main challenges were getting a finite sound file to play continuously for as long as the key was pressed, and getting an arbitrary number of keys to play at the same time to create chords.

                <p> Below is a demo of me "playing" the piano. A warning for your ears, I still don't know how to play very well--but at least I know how to 3d print one!
