            <h1>The bottom shelf</h1>
            <p> A collection of original designs that I do like but are a bit too random to go in the <a href="./portfolio.html">main portfolio</a>. 
                 In other words, if this were a physical display, these would be put on the bottom shelf.
                 <br><br> 
                 There are many more designs beyond what is on this page and the portfolio--but most of them aren't much worth seeing. 
                 In the past, other origami artists and I have participated in Inktober (a new design every day for a month) 
                 or speed designing challenges (design something within 10 minutes), and only the few of the outcomes of such quantity-over-quality activities
                 have actually led to interesting designs, and that's just how any creative process is meant to be. But here are some of them.

                    <p><b>Growing sprout</b>, June 2020. An interesting action model.
                        I also made a <a href="https://youtu.be/sAlkHi7Tm2c">tutorial</a>.</p>

                    <p><b>Pikmin</b>, July 2018 (refolded in April 2020). I played a lot of the Pikmin games with my brother when we were kids,
                        so these guys bring back the memories. They all have the same base but different shaping for the ears/eyes/hair 
                        (I later made the red one with a different structure for the nose, but not until after I finished the <a href="https://youtu.be/Ut6NX1FN3aA">tutorial</a>).
                        The yellow and purple on the left are life size: a mere 4cm from toe to tip.
